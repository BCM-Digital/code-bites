# HTML + CSS (Sass) challenge
Your objective is to create a flat HTML page that represents the design below:

- [Desktop view](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26587063/24184508/ff86f072-0f19-11e7-9145-d6ae62852f8d.png)
- [Mobile view](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26587063/24184509/ffb5e616-0f19-11e7-9010-a4ebf6fddd34.png)

## Requirements
- The page should be built mobile-first and respond to the vast majority of viewport sizes.
    - You may interpolate how you see fit the designs for viewports between mobile and desktop.
- The header and footer should always stay the same height.
    - Header height is **434px**
    - Footer height is **199px**
- The main content (white area with grey squares) should fill all remaining space on the page and keep the grey squares in its vertical center at all times.
- The grey squares should have a maximum width of **296px** but can shrink down on small viewports.
- You need to write the CSS using Sass and preferably follow a methodology such as [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/).
- You need to use a build tool such as Gulp, but you're free to use any others if you're more familiar with them.
- Your site needs to be valid HTML5 and make use of HTML5 tags such as `header`, `footer`, `section` etc.
- Your site should work as expected across all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE11/Edge etc).

## Additional information
- The font used is Roboto (weights: black, regular and light).
    - You can import it through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
- The background colors in the header that form the gradient are `#DB2475` and `#F63D3D`
    - The text color is white `#FFFFFF`
- The background color of the grey boxes are `#E4E4E4`
    - The text color is `#7A7A7A`
- The footer background color is `#444444`
